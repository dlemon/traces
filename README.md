Space Time Augmented Reality Library for Unity.

## History
From April 19th until April 22th 2018 Germany's first free VR festival ['Places'](https://www.facebook.com/events/129825094370177/) took place in the city of Gelsenkirchen. The location of the festival was spread out over locations at the Bochumer Straße, including the 'Wissenschaftpark' where a Hackathon took place. The Team Absolute Beginners AKA Halte Stelle+ programmed an AR app helping people unfamiliar with a city's public transport system to navigate to the nearest bus station and choose the correct bus heading to their destination of choice.

Inspired by the possibilities of AR and the VR festival itself, a new open source AR project is started: traces.

## Concept
The hub of the VR festival was located around the church square at the Bochumer Straße, and with 'Traces' it is possible to re-visit the VR festival in space time. A markerless, location based AR app 'Traces' will show traces of the festival in Space Time around the square at the Bochumer Straße in Gelsenkirchen. 

Based on location (space) you can walk through a virtual exhibition showing you permanent traces of the VR Places festival in real life size. Based on time you can visit and look at temporary traces: events that took place during the festival at your current location during your current time.

## Possibilities
Location based history of your city. AR guided city tours. Interactive locations. Think augmenting 'Stolper Steine' in your city, record events or visualize life sized planned buildings. The possibilities are endless.

## Next Steps
A set of libraries are being developed which eventually will be a space time library and platform for creating apps like 'Traces'. In parallel the proof of concept app 'Traces' is going to be build.
